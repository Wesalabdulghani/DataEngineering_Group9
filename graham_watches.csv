This model has a GMT hand that allows the second time zone to be read simultaneously. This provides a technical answer for people who travel constantly, juggling time zones. In order to standardize the measurement of time in all countries, the earth has been divided into 24 time zones, the first of which is crossed by the Greenwich meridian and is considered the prime meridian. From this central point, 12 time zones were defined running westwards from -11 to 0 (0 = GMT - centre of the time zones) and a further 12 from +1 to +12 eastwards.

This model has a GMT hand that allows the second time zone to be read simultaneously. This provides a technical answer for people who travel constantly, juggling time zones. In order to standardize the measurement of time in all countries, the earth has been divided into 24 time zones, the first of which is crossed by the Greenwich meridian and is considered the prime meridian. From this central point, 12 time zones were defined running westwards from -11 to 0 (0 = GMT - centre of the time zones) and a further 12 from +1 to +12 eastwards. GRAHAM has developed one of the simplest GMTs in the world, allowing you to set your watch without ever using the crown.

There was a need to pay tribute to George Graham fan- tastic heritage to the watch history. No doubt for us, the best way was to add to our magnificent collection a symbol of tradition and passion for mechanical arts : the TOURBILLON.But it was clear that it should not be just another tourbillon:It had to be a breakthrough, a new step in the conquest of watch making paradise.A unique timekeeper fitting to both our beloved core values and the respectful feel- ings we all have towards George Graham. It had to be innovative, proactive, with our touch of eccentricity, sporty and highly gutsy.
The development of a unique time piece had begun. The task was heavy. The brief was crazy.A new concept of Tourbillon, a new technology, 2 new patents, a new manufacturing process and 4 years of unremitting endeavours were the conditions to come up with a master piece dedicated to our flame of design and bearing any type of intense activity.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0274/0921/9648/files/Chronofighter_Superlight_Carbon_Tourbillograph_-_technical_features_2CCBK.B35A_-_update_2021.pdf?v=1670927875

Located on the left side of the case, the pusher has been completely redesigned to become the only pusher allowing the hour hand to be moved by 1 hour. This makes it easy to update the time while on the move. Each Graham watch is water tested to 300 feet (100 meters/10atm). This model has a GMT hand that allows the second time zone to be read simultaneously. This provides a technical answer for people who travel constantly, juggling time zones. In order to standardize the measurement of time in all countries, the earth has been divided into 24 time zones, the first of which is crossed by the Greenwich meridian and is considered the prime meridian. From this central point, 12 time zones were defined running westwards from -11 to 0 (0 = GMT - centre of the time zones) and a further 12 from +1 to +12 eastwards. GRAHAM has developed one of the simplest GMTs in the world, allowing you to set your watch without ever using the crown.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0274/0921/9648/files/fiche_technique_-_Fortress_-_GMT_City.pdf?v=1685027655
